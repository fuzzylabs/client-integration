# .NET Cloud Vision Samples

A collection of samples that demonstrate how to call the 
Google Cloud Vision API from C#.

The vision samples in this repo cover only a _subset_ of the available types of image 
feature detections provided by the Cloud Vision API that you can call using C# and the .NET Framework.
 - [Label Detection](labelDetection)
 - [Text Detection](textDetection)


See the full list of [image feature types](https://cloud.google.com/vision/reference/rest/v1/images/annotate#type)
