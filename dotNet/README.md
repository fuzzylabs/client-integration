# .NET Docs Samples

A collection of samples that demonstrate how to call some
Google Cloud services from C#.

[Google API Client Libraries page](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/apis/)
lists all the APIs you can call from .NET.

The samples in this repo cover only a _small fraction_ of the total APIs that you can call from .NET.
 - [Auth](auth)
 - [Big Query](bigquery/api)
 - [Storage](storage/api)
 - [Vision](vision)

The [Auth](auth) sample will probably be useful no matter which API you call.

See our other [Google Cloud Platform github
repos](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform) for sample applications and
scaffolding for other frameworks and use cases.
